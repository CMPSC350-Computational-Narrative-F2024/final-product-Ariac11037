# CMPSC 350: Project Plan

## Summary

An interactive choose-your-own-adventure narrative based on mental health, where the reader can make their own decisions in the narrative and reach multiple possible endings.
Throughout the narrative, mental health themes and journaling prompts will be integrated as part of the narrative's experience.
This project will build off of my project 3, which is a generative mental health journaling program.

## Peer works

1. Depression Quest.
It is a choose-your-own-adventure game depicting the life of someone struggling with depression.
I would like to take inspiration from the structure of the game.

2. Queers in Love at the End of the World.
This is an LGBTQ game about two people in love when the world is ending in 10 seconds.
It was made with Twine, which is the platform I am considering using to make the final product.

3. Night in the Woods.
This game features dialogue choices and a protagonist dealing with mental health challenges.
Journaling is a key mechanic, as players add sketches and notes to a journal based on their experiences.
For my own project, I would like to have the journalling aspect be more food for thought rather than part of the narrative, like Night in the Woods.

## Challenges

General challenges would be integrating the generative aspect of the project, as well as figuring out how the final product design will look.
