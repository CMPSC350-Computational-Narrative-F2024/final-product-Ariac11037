# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work

Title of the narrative: Lost in Translation

## Description

Provide a 3-5 sentence description of your progress to this point. What has been
difficult? What has been enjoyable? Has your concept changed or shifted in any meaningful way?

At this point, I have started working with an LLM to generate the narrative of my CYOA game.
It has been extremely enjoyable, using chain-of-thought and few-shot and many-shot prompting
to indirectly guide the LLM in generating the narrative. Difficulty has still been trying to
decide what the final product will look like as a whole, but I've got the basic template down
through using Twine. I also feel the direction of my project has changed slightly, as at first
I had the idea of generating the storyline bit by bit depending on the player's choices. However,
I feel like that type of generation would be very difficult to implement, so I switched to having
an LLM generate a set storyline, with different choices, in its entirety.

## Peer Feedback

Identify at least 3 questions to pose to an in-class peer.

What techinical strategy did you use for your project and storytelling?
How did you implement the LLM API into your storytelling?
What kinds of challenges are you experiencing? Particularly any big concerns?

### Unstructured peer feedback

Dedicate this space to a summative comment from a peer. This may require you to share
this repository (briefly) with this person for them to replace this paragraph with the comment.

From Charlie: I think this project is really interesting and provides a great way to educate people on the struggles of
mental health and how surrounding cultural circles can affect that. I think that it is smart to "add up" points in order to
get to one of the three endings and was not something I had thought of before. I also think that the way Aria is using Chat-GPT
to help create the background and storyline makes sense and is a good use of an LLM for user-based story purposes.

## Persisting challenges

Highlight challenges which continue to hamper progress.

Currently, I still have no idea how my final product will look for its user interface.
I am also not super sure on how to implement the point system I have in place for the choices that lead to the endings.
