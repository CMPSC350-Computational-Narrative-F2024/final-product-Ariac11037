# CMPSC 350: Project Progress

## Provide a tentative title for the work

Title of the narrative: Lost in Translation

## Description

Provide a 3-5 sentence description of your progress to this point. What has been
difficult? What has been enjoyable? Has your concept changed or shifted in any meaningful way?

At this point, I have started working with an LLM to generate the narrative of my CYOA game.
It has been extremely enjoyable, using chain-of-thought and few-shot and many-shot prompting
to indirectly guide the LLM in generating the narrative. Difficulty has still been trying to
decide what the final product will look like as a whole, but I've got the basic template down
through using Twine. I also feel the direction of my project has changed slightly, as at first
I had the idea of generating the storyline bit by bit depending on the player's choices. However,
I feel like that type of generation would be very difficult to implement, so I switched to having
an LLM generate a set storyline, with different choices, in its entirety.
