# CMPSC 350: Final Reflection

## Final title

Lost In Translation

## Summary

Lost In Translation is a generative CYOA narrative about someone going through mental health challenges and has to navigate different areas of their life, including personal life, work, relationships, family, and their cultural identity. It covers themes of anxiety, depression, cultural identity, navigating generational divides, and being "enough" for both family and society.

## Reference works

1. Depression Quest

2. Mental Health Journalling Project (Project 3)

3. Twine

This work was heavily influenced by Depression Quest.
I wanted to create a similar mental health game, but also incorporate my own ideas and aspects into this game as well to make it a more personally immersive experience.
This project is also a continuation of my previous project 3 based on the journalling aspect of my game.
Lastly, I used Twine to create and format my narrative. 
Through using Twine, I have learned how to navigate it and also implement coding into my narrative, which was quite interesting to learn about.

## Describe your single largest success

My largest success was figuring out how to implement coding onto Twine.
I did not know anything about how coding worked on a third party platform like Twine, but thankfully my code was not very complicated.
I was able to figure it out successfully, and every aspect works.

## Describe your single largest challenge or failure

My largest challenge for this project was trying to think about the user interface.
Up until now, I still haven't figured it out properly.
Also, generating the narrative is extremely time consuming, and so I lacked the time to try to work on how I wanted the user interface to look.

## The role of feedback

The role of feedback in this project was extremely helpful.
I really enjoyed hearing other's thoughts about my idea, and it is helpful for me to receive constructive criticism as well.

Examples below:

From Miles: I think Aria has a fascinating idea. Creating a choose-your-own-adventure game centered on mental health is both engaging and meaningful.
It’s a great way to build on your previous project, adding depth and relevance.
Using Twine for this concept is an excellent choice, as it’s well-suited for interactive storytelling and will allow you to effectively convey the complexities of mental health experiences

From Charlie: I think this project is really interesting and provides a great way to educate people on the struggles of
mental health and how surrounding cultural circles can affect that.
I think that it is smart to "add up" points in order to get to one of the three endings and was not something I had thought of before.
I also think that the way Aria is using Chat-GPT to help create the background and storyline makes sense and is a good use of an LLM for user-based story purposes.

## Contextualizing

This course asked you to understand language as technology and information for carrying,
permuting, combining, destroying, and altering ideas. How does your work fit into your understanding
of the course? If there's one final take-away from participating in creative diversion/adventure into
technology, narrative, and meaning, what is it and how did it factor into this longform work?

My work fits into my understanding of language and technology by showcasing how narrative and meaning can be shaped and reshaped through the careful selection and arrangement of words.

One key takeaway from this creative adventure is the realization that language is not just a medium for communication but also a dynamic tool for innovation and expression.
This insight has influenced my longform work by encouraging me to experiment with different narrative structures and linguistic techniques to convey complex themes and emotions.

For example, in my project, I explored the theme of cultural expectations and personal identity through a family dinner scene.
By using descriptive language and dialogue, I was able to illustrate the tension between tradition and individuality with the choices made available to the player, demonstrating how language can both reflect and challenge societal norms.

Overall, this course has deepened my appreciation for the versatility of language and its capacity to shape our understanding of the world.
It has inspired me to continue exploring the intersections of technology, narrative, and meaning in my future work.
